# DISCLAMER: THIS CODE WAS WRITTEN WITH MAGIC NIPPLE'S XASH3D VS2019 BUILD IN MIND SO IF YOU PLAN TO USE THIS CODE FOR ANY OTHER XASH BRANCH OR STEAM HALF LIFE YOU MAY HAVE TO REWRITE BITS OF THIS CODE

***

**Contents**\
This is just some simple code for a fully automatic shotgun, It was originally made with an aa12 in mind so many things will appear to reference it which also explains some of the included assets in this as well. Obviously this doesn't have to be an AA12 but for demonstration purposes the assets I include are going to have this in mind. You may notice comments left by Jay which I intentionally left in on purpose because I can't take full credit for writing this code, Their help on this was vital to this as this is my first proper weapon code.
